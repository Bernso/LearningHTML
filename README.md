# LearningHTML and CSS
This is me (Ben) learning how to code in HTML and css.
Here you will see my progress from the  very beginning (22/01/2024) to when I can actually code in HTML well and confidently!
# The CSS
You may think "Where's all this css Ben's talking about doing?" I have used <style></style> inside of the HTML file to be able to code with CSS and HTML inside of the same file, I do this because it makes file management a lot easier in my opinion (although my naming skills aren't the greatest as you can clearly see).
